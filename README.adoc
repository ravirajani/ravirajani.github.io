The AsciiDoc sources listed in https://github.com/ravirajani/ravirajani.github.io/blob/main/config.yml[config.yml] will automatically get converted to HTML and deployed to GitHub Pages when pushing your changes, provided you have enabled *GitHub Actions* as your Build and Deployment Source under `Settings > Pages`.

If you want to build the site locally, install the dependencies with `bundle install` and then run `adoctohtml`. This will
build your site in the `www` folder.
