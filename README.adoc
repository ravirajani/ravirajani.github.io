== Template repository for asciidoctor-html

The AsciiDoc sources will automatically get converted to HTML and deployed to GitHub Pages when pushing your changes.

If you want to build the site locally, install the dependencies with `bundle install` and then run `adoctohtml`. This will
build your site in the `www/` folder.
