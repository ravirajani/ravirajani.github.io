= Welcome

I am a lecturer in Mathematics and Data Science at the https://ase.uva.nl/[Amsterdam School of Economics], part of the https://uva.nl/[University of Amsterdam].

I am the developer of https://ravirajani.github.io/asciidoctor-html/[asciidoctor-html] which helps me produce accessible HTML lecture notes from https://asciidoc.org/[AsciiDoc] sources.
